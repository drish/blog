Hey.

My name is Derich Pacheco, I currently work for [ThinkData Works](http://thinkdataworks.com/#/), as a Software Engineering Team Lead where I push forward our internal data processing tools, architecture and ETL pipelines.

I will be mostly writing about software engineering, more specifically: distributed systems, system's design and infrastructure.

I am originally from the city where the [easternmost point of the American continents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponta_do_Seixas) is located, but I moved to Toronto/Canada, when I was 22.

Please do not hesitate do say hi !
